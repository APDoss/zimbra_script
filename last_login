############################################ Script to get the users, before the mentioned lastlogin date ############################################
1.Run the script as a "zimbra user"
2.It would be better to run the script in /tmp directory
3.The script has two conditions
  i) It will look only the closed users
 ii) The letter "R" should be mentioned in the description of user in zimbra adminconsole
4.If the contions in the point 3 is achieved, Then the script will provide the users who has the last login date less than the date we are mentioning


#!/bin/bash

date=$1
domain=$2

if [ $# -eq 2 ]
then
 for i in `zmaccts | grep closed | grep -v never | awk '{print $1}' | awk -F '@' '{print $1}'| grep -v domain`
 do
 last_login=`zmaccts | grep ^$i@ | awk '{print $5}'`
   if [ "$last_login" \< "$date" ];
   then
   dis=`zmprov ga $i@$domain | grep -i Description | grep -o R`
     if [ "$dis" == 'R' ];
     then
       echo "$i@$domain    $last_login"
     fi
   fi
 done
else
 echo "Run the script as follows \"sh last_login.sh mm/dd/yy domain\" "
 echo "mm/dd/yy - last login date"
 echo "doamin - example.com"
fi
